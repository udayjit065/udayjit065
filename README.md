# Selected Projects

## VYUGEN — Semantic Question Retrieval System  
https://vyu-gen.vercel.app/home

Semantic search system for structured academic question datasets.

System components:
- Text embedding generation
- Similarity-based ranking
- Topic filtering
- Dataset ingestion and indexing

Built as a full stack application with ML-backed retrieval.

Notes:  
Demo runs in a limited compute environment and does not represent full system performance.

---

## Voclize — Real-Time Speech Fluency Analysis  
https://voclize-demo.vercel.app/

Streaming speech processing system that measures speaking behavior using quantifiable metrics.

Core functionality:
- Real-time speech-to-text
- Speaking rate estimation
- Pause detection
- Filler word tracking
- Session-level fluency scoring

Designed for structured communication analysis rather than subjective evaluation.

Notes:  
Demo operates under restricted API usage and limited streaming duration.

# Additional Machine Learning Work

### Music Recommendation Model
Similarity-based recommendation using feature distance and clustering.

### Transformer Sentiment Classification
DistilBERT fine-tuned for text polarity prediction.
